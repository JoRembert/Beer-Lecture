# Beer: a Lecture (Tasting Included) by Sergey Konstantinov

Beer. The most modest and unassuming beverage, a filler for supermarket shelves. At the same time—a staple of the economies of many nations for millennia. Egyptian pyramid builders were paid with it, polar explorers took it to the North Pole as life-sustaining support, workers of Brussels once rioted because its price was up by two centimes. In this book, a centuries-long beer history is told in a comprehensive, interesting, and *practical* manner. You will learn which beer styles were popular in each epoch, from Bronze Age to the 21st century, understand the reasons why, and, which is the most important, explore the history by taste.

This is the working repository for ‘Beer: a Lecture (Tasting Included)’ book being written by Sergey Konstantinov ([email](mailto:twirl-team@yandex.ru), [Linkedin profile](https://linkedin.com/in/twirl)). **The work is very much in progress**.

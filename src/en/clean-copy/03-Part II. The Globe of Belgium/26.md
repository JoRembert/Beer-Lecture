### The Devil for Sale

With the monks working hard for themselves and for all other beer-makers in the world, commercial brewing in Belgium steadily began moving forward as well. The Prohibition law and competing foreign beers gave it some impetus. At the beginning of the 20th century, Belgian beers typically had 2.5% to 4.5% ABV (only *lambic* was stronger, around 6%). Though German and Dutch lagers were also around 3% to 5%, British brews were much stronger, even more so, their export versions. So it was not surprising that early strong Belgian beers were… British[ref:{"source":{"alias":"gillman-beer-et-seq","short":"Gillman, G.","extra":"Gary Gillman's Beer et seq.","href":"https://www.beeretseq.com/"}}:"Trappist Ale And English Ale – Connections"](https://www.beeretseq.com/trappist-ale-and-english-ale-connections/).

In 1923 (or 1918, as some sources claim) the Moortgat brewery released its special strong ‘Victory Ale’ to celebrate the end of the First World War. To do so, one of the Moortgat brothers, Albert, went to Scotland searching for proper yeasts (and had found them either at William McEwan’s or William Younger’s brewery — the sources are again inconclusive)[ref:{"short":"Kearney, B. (2021)","extra":["The Duvel’s in the Detail. How a Belgian Golden Strong Ale Became So Iconic","Belgian Smaak"]}](https://www.belgiansmaak.com/the-duvels-in-the-detail-duvel-moortgat/). More importantly, he brought not only the yeasts, but the recipe as well: in fact, Victory Ale was a Belgian interpretation of the classical Scottish Ale (which was, in turn, the Scottish interpretation of the classical English barleywine) and had the impressive 8.5% ABV. So impressive that the local shoemaker named Van De Wouwer reportedly called it ‘the real devil’ (‘nen echten Duvel’ in the local dialect) — and the Moortgats unhesitatingly renamed ‘Victory Ale’ into ‘Duvel’.

Fun Fact. One brewer named Alfred Dubuisson went even further than this. After inheriting the family brewery in the Hainaut province, he decided to compete against British beers and, in 1933, prepared a special version of barleywine as strong as 12% ABV. The brew was named ‘Bush’ to stress the connection — in fact, he translated his very last name into English!

Both alcoholic exercises were dark (amber in the case of ‘Bush’) thick barleywines, quite uncharacteristic for Belgium of that period, and, probably, because of that were not particularly popular. Changes were brewing, and they happened in the 1960s. Emile Moortgat, who represented the third generation of the Moortgat family brewers, enlisted Jean De Clerck to help re-inventing Duvel. And De Clerck succeeded: he bred pure yeast strains and altered the technological processes of malting and brewing to create a new beer style in its strength and aroma comparable to *tripel* and in its lightness and clarity, to lager. Today this beer style is usually denoted as ‘Belgian strong pale ale’ or ‘Belgian strong golden ale’.

Making such a strong beer that is at the same time so pale and clear requires employing intricate techniques: 
  * exposing to high temperatures is to be avoided at any stage, as it results in darker beers; 
  * sugar syrup is replaced with the dextrose one; 
  * attenuation is increased: Duvel is an extraordinarily dry beer.

#### How to taste

Of course, the No. 1 choice is Duvel itself, which can be found even in corner shops. Apart from the original Duvel, one of its first competitors in this style deserves a special mention: ‘Delirium Tremens’ by Brouwerij Huyghe (they are also producing one more magnificent strong golden ale under the ‘La Guillotine’ brand).

As the style became popular, many brewers, both traditional and craft ones, began to make it. Those most critically acclaimed are:

  * Blonde by La Chouffe (which was, by the way, bought by the Moortgats at some point);
  * Gnommegang by Ommegang (which was — guess, what? — also bought by the Moortgats);
  * Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Blond;
  * Piraat by Van Steenberge;
  * Stille Nacht by De Dolle.

The above-mentioned Dubuisson brewery also makes a strong golden ale named ‘De Charmes’.

#### The wind of change

As the history of Belgian brewing demonstrates, just making a quality product is not enough — the art of selling it is a must-have as well. At the beginning of the 80s, Belgium was producing a mind-blowing range of beers to suit any taste:

  * *faro*, *lambic*, *gueuze*, and their cherry and raspberry varieties;
  * *dubbel*, *tripel*, and (how they will later call it) *quadrupel*;
  * Orval and *saison*;
  * the Flanders brown;
  * strong golden ales after by the Moortgats;
  * *witbier* after Pierre Celis;
  * …and regular *pilsner* and pale ales as well.

The changes were brewing not only in Belgium but across the seas as well, in Britain and the United States. Only a sparkle was needed to start the fire of the craft revolution — the story of which we will tell you in the next chapter.

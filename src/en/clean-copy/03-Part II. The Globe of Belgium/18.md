### March

The ‘lambic’, ‘faro’, and ‘gueuze’ words were changing their meaning but still kept referring to the same technology; with ‘march’ beer it's more complicated. This word was used to denote different beverages that had just a common feature — the timing. March was traditionally considered to be the best month for brewing, as stable low temperatures allowed for making the finest beer. In Belgium, they used the ‘march’ designations (‘Mars’, ‘Meert’, ‘bière de Mars’) for keeping beers, aged for 4 to 6 month: weak lambics and so-called ‘saisons’, or ‘bière de garde’[ref:{"source":{"alias":"hors-categorie","short":"Janssen, D.","extra":"Hors Catégorie Brewing","href":"http://www.horscategoriebrewing.com"}}:"Biere de Mars (the lambic version) and Lambic in the mid 1800s (part 1)"](http://www.horscategoriebrewing.com/2015/11/biere-de-mars-lambic-version-and-lambic.html). The main difference between the two was that the former was fermented fully spontaneously, absorbing the ‘wild’ airborne microorganisms, while the latter was prepared by first adding regular yeasts, then surrendering to the ‘bretts’ after the primary fermentation.

(There is also a German ‘march’ beer — *Märzen* — but it's a lager.)

First *saisons* were brewed in Liège at least from the beginning of the 19th century. Liège saison was dry, relatively strong, and, as a typical product of the period, contained a large proportion of spelt malt and unmalted wheat. At the end of the century, saisons became popular in Charleroi and other towns of the Hainaut province, though the word was not strictly referring to a specific style, but rather just a keeping beer in general: darker beer could be marked as ‘bruin saison’ as well[ref:mulder-lost-beers:"What was a 19th century saison really like?"](https://lostbeers.com/what-was-a-19th-century-saison-really-like/).

However, it later got a more specific meaning: pale keeping beer (implying mixed fermentation, partially fermented with ‘bretts’), dry, made from barley and wheat. Closer to the end of the century it became almost indistinguishable from ‘grisette’ — initially, cheap dark beer for miners.

#### How to taste

Three companies have been continuously brewing saison for more than a hundred years. They are:

  * Brasserie à Vapeur with their Saison de Pipaix;
  * Brasserie de Silly with Silly Saison;
  * Martens from Limburg with a bunch of ‘Sezoens’ beers.

The Brasserie à Vapeur is also notable for the 19th-century Watt steam engine that still powers all the mechanisms in the brewery. (The words ‘à Vapeur’ literally mean ‘steam-powered’.)

Many other Belgian breweries are making saisons nowadays, most notably Fantôme Saison and Saison Dupont. Among craft brewers, Hill Farmstead and Two Side Project have made saisons their specialties. French version of the style known as ‘bière de garde’ is being produced by Brasserie 3 MONTS and Brasserie Duyck, to name a few.

Grisette also enjoys some demand, though it's rather hard to notice any difference between modern saison and grisette.

#### Seasonal confusion

And one more thing: saison happened to be the main victim of dilettante historians. Almost everything written about it (both online and offline) is not true. If you search for information on this beer style, you will learn that it was a beer made by farmers during winter and spring using their own grain to be consumed by seasonal workers in the summer and autumn months and that it was a typical beer from the Hainaut province. In fact, it was quite the opposite[ref:mulder-lost-beers:"Fact check: Yvan De Baets on saison (and the results may shock you)"](https://lostbeers.com/fact-check-yvan-de-baets-on-saison-and-the-results-may-shock-you/):

  * first, the beer was made by professional brewers from purchased grain; saisons were actively sold to other regions and countries, and even participated international expos and competitions;
  * second, it is started to be produced in Hainaut much later than in other regions; ‘saison’ beer was known in Liège from at least 1832, while the oldest mention of making it in Hainaut comes from 1858;

The Lacambre's treatise doesn't mention any farmhouse production of saisons as well. In 1851, ‘saison’ meant Liège beer made from spelt and wheat in winter or early spring, aged 4-6 months (if the beer was brewed in march itself, it was aged until the end of the year)[ref:lacambre:376-378]().

Despite the fact that literally no evidence suggests that saisons were brewed by farmers, the entire category of these mixed-fermented beers is now known as ‘farmhouse ales’. And grisette is told to be a saison for miners, whatever it might mean.

### Biology and Chemistry

Out of the traditional beer styles of Belgium, *lambic* definitely holds the top spot as the beer possessing the greatest popularity and the longevity of the tradition alike. We assume that almost every human in the world had heard at least vaguely about the famous beer fermented with unique yeasts that reside only in the Brussels area (or maybe in the Belgian province of Lambic) or tried its cherry variety.

Surprisingly, despite the universal acclaim, we know very little about the history of this beer and its origin. Today we use three different words to denote lambic variants:
  * ‘lambic’ itself for the base version;
  * ‘faro’ to mark young sweetened lambic;
  * and ‘geuze’ (or ‘gueuze’) meaning the blend of young and aged lambics.

All those words were still historically denoting subtypes of the very same beer as today, but their meaning had changed over centuries. The oldest one is ‘faro’: it was first mentioned in 1721 as the strongest Brussels beer. In 1794, the word ‘lambic’ occurred as a designation of the strongest and the most expensive *faro*, and in 1829, even stronger *geuze* emerged. All those beers were ‘yellow’, and were brewed using a significant amount of unmalted wheat. (The proportion of which had been steadily declining throughout the 19th century; we might suppose that with the spread of pale malts the necessity of using expensive wheat to clarify the beer had been reducing.)

The word ‘lambic’ was initially spelled like that: ‘allembique’, e.g. ‘al lembic’. So it can't derive from the town of Lembeek (which sometimes becomes a non-existent ‘province of Lambic’ in popular myth). It seems to be borrowed from Arabic, being a variation of spelling the word ‘alembic’, meaning the distillation cube. How exactly *lambic* was connected to alembic is not yet understood fully. Some scholars suppose that strong and clear *lambic* was thought to be a product of distillation by contemporaries; others say it was some slang word. Both hypotheses, however, are just guessing as we lack any facts they can possibly rely upon[ref:mulder-lost-beers:"Lambic: the real story"](https://lostbeers.com/lambic-the-real-story/).

Still, why were faro/lambic/geuze unusually clear and strong beers? As we have learned from the ‘Barrels and Bretts’ chapter, the main practical method of achieving both characteristics was aging beer in barrels where it was undergoing secondary fermentation caused by ‘wild’ yeasts. The technology was well known in 17th-century England, and it had probably reached Belgium in the 18th century.

Beer Myth. It is often said that lambic is known since at least the 15th century, despite the fact the word first occurred in 1794. Also, it is often quoted that peasants at the Peter Breughel the Elder paintings were drinking beer — though no single fact supports this claim.

The Belgians, however, went much farther in the adoption of the technology than the English brewers. If ‘bretts’ were rather unavoidable in the stock beer manufacturing, the lambic brewers were deliberately adjusting recipes to be fermented with them — at least the 1829 and 1834 descriptions fully feature it. To achieve this goal, the wort was poured into the large shallow vessels and left in the open air to ‘soak’ the atmosphere. After that, future lambic was placed in the controllable environment — plainly speaking, into a barrel with a regulated oxygen inflow — and left for fermenting at least for a year. In fact, the production of lambic is just a process of a controllable souring of wort.

Unlike stock ales, which are not being produced for a long time, the microbiology of lambics was studied in detail. It turned out that the view of fermenting lambic with ‘wild’ yeasts is a gross oversimplification. In fact, there are at least four different stages of fermenting, each dominated by different types of microorganisms[ref:{"source":{"alias":"guinard-lambic","short":"Guinard, J.

  1. Enterobacteria are first to start consuming dissolved sugars breaking them down into lactic acid, acetic acid, and ethyl alcohol, and amino acids — into amines, peptides, myristic and linoleic acids. Enterobacteria dominate first days of future lambic's life, and then *kloekera apiculata* yeasts join them, which consume glucose and produce the protease enzyme that helps to break down complex proteins.

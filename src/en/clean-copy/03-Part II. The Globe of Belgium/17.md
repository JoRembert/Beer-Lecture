### Biology and Chemistry

Out of the traditional beer styles of Belgium, *lambic* definitely holds the top spot as the beer possessing the greatest popularity and the longevity of the tradition alike. We assume that almost every human in the world had heard at least vaguely about the famous beer fermented with unique yeasts that reside only in the Brussels area (or maybe in the Belgian province of Lambic) or tried its cherry variety.

Surprisingly, despite the universal acclaim, we know very little about the history of this beer and its origin. Today we use three different words to denote lambic variants:
  * ‘lambic’ itself for the base version;
  * ‘faro’ to mark young sweetened lambic;
  * and ‘geuze’ (or ‘gueuze’) meaning the blend of young and aged lambics.

All those words were still historically denoting subtypes of the very same beer as today, but their meaning had changed over centuries. The oldest one is ‘faro’: it was first mentioned in 1721 as the strongest Brussels beer. In 1794, the word ‘lambic’ occurred as a designation of the strongest and the most expensive *faro*, and in 1829, even stronger *geuze* emerged. All those beers were ‘yellow’, and were brewed using a significant amount of unmalted wheat. (The proportion of which had been steadily declining throughout the 19th century; we might suppose that with the spread of pale malts the necessity of using expensive wheat to clarify the beer had been reducing.)

The word ‘lambic’ was initially spelled like that: ‘allembique’, e.g. ‘al lembic’. So it can't derive from the town of Lembeek (which sometimes becomes a non-existent ‘province of Lambic’ in popular myth). It seems to be borrowed from Arabic, being a variation of spelling the word ‘alembic’, meaning the distillation cube. How exactly *lambic* was connected to alembic is not yet understood fully. Some scholars suppose that strong and clear *lambic* was thought to be a product of distillation by contemporaries; others say it was some slang word. Both hypotheses, however, are just guessing as we lack any facts they can possibly rely upon[ref:mulder-lost-beers:"Lambic: the real story"](https://lostbeers.com/lambic-the-real-story/).

Still, why were faro/lambic/geuze unusually clear and strong beers? As we have learned from the ‘Barrels and Bretts’ chapter, the main practical method of achieving both characteristics was aging beer in barrels where it was undergoing secondary fermentation caused by ‘wild’ yeasts. The technology was well known in 17th-century England, and it had probably reached Belgium in the 18th century.

Beer Myth. It is often said that lambic is known since at least the 15th century, despite the fact the word first occurred in 1794. Also, it is often quoted that peasants at the Peter Breughel the Elder paintings were drinking beer — though no single fact supports this claim.

The Belgians, however, went much farther in the adoption of the technology than the English brewers. If ‘bretts’ were rather unavoidable in the stock beer manufacturing, the lambic brewers were deliberately adjusting recipes to be fermented with them — at least the 1829 and 1834 descriptions fully feature it. To achieve this goal, the wort was poured into the large shallow vessels and left in the open air to ‘soak’ the atmosphere. After that, future lambic was placed in the controllable environment — plainly speaking, into a barrel with a regulated oxygen inflow — and left for fermenting at least for a year. In fact, the production of lambic is just a process of a controllable spoilage of wort[ref:{"source":{"alias":"guinard-lambic","short":"Guinard, J. (1990)","extra":["Lambic","ISBN 0937381225"]}}:"5"]().

Scientists attempted to study in detail the microbiology of lambic at least twice. The first attempt was made by researchers from the University of Leuven in 1977[ref:{"source":{"alias":"spontaneous-beer-fermentation","short":"Oevelen, D. van, Spaepen M., Timmermans P., Verachtert H. (1977)","extra":["Microbilogocal Aspects of Spontaneous Wort Fermentation in the production of lambic and Gueuze"]}}:](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.2050-0416.1977.tb03825.x). It turned out there were at least four different stages of fermenting, each dominated by different types of microorganisms.

  1. Enterobacteria are first to start consuming dissolved sugars breaking them down into lactic acid, acetic acid, and ethyl alcohol; amino acids — into amines, peptides, myristic and linoleic acids. Enterobacteria dominate the first days of future lambic's life, and then *kloekera apiculata* yeasts join them, which consume glucose and produce the protease enzyme that helps to break down complex proteins.

  2. In two weeks' time, both bacteria and *kloekera* are superseded by regular baker's yeasts. At this stage, normal alcohol fermentation happens: glucose, maltose and maltotriose are converted into ethyl alcohol and different saturated fatty acids such as caprylic and capric ones.

  3. Next four months, lactic acid bacteria (mainly of *pediococcus* genus) dominate. They significantly increase acidity by producing lactic acid, acetoin, and diacetyl.

  4. Finally, starting from the ninth month, ‘bretts’ suppress the growth of the remaining microbiota and start slowly but steadily reprocessing everything generated at the previous stages — including lactic, acetic, and other acids — emitting complex esters that are responsible for the taste and the aroma of lambic.

And that's not all: apart from the above-mentioned, yeasts of Pichia, Candida, Hansenula, Cryptococcus genus as well as other microorganisms are making some contribution. To brew a proper lambic, you need not just some particular kind of yeast but a package of specific lambic biota.

In 2014, another group of researchers repeated the experiment. The results were controversial: though the stages remained the same, the concrete kinds of microorganisms dominating each stage were totally different[ref:{"source":{"alias":"spitaels-diversity","short":"Spitaels, F., Wieme, A.D., Janssens, M., Aerts, M., Daniel, H.-M., Van Landschoot, A., De Vuyst, L., Vandamme, P. (2014)","extra":["The Microbial Diversity of Traditional Spontaneously Fermented Lambic Beer","PLOS ONE, April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e95384"],"href":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095384"}}](), which inevitably leads us to the next question.

#### Mixing, mixing…

From the above-written, it should be obvious that lambic is an extremely complex product to produce. It is definitely not a Medieval beer but rather the outcome of the stock ale technology revolution, so it's unlikely it emerged before the 18th century. (Usage of just wheat and barley, without oats, spelt, and buckwheat that were a characteristic of earlier Belgian and Dutch beer, actually tells us the same story: lambic was quite a new and advanced beer style.) We should rather ask ourselves: how was it possible to produce such an elaborate product in those primitive conditions without precise measuring tools? How could one control if the fermentation stages in young lambic were developing properly?

Certainly, brewers might regulate oxygen inflow thus suppressing or buffing the growth of specific microorganisms. Weather provided some control as well; in particular, the increase of lactic acid bacteria presence corresponds with warm summer months. Of course, the brewers' books from those times contain lots of tips and tricks on how to mitigate undesirable changes; for example, to counter the over-increased acidity, adding eggshells was prescribed, though we might guess it hardly helped at all. Still, one extremely effective tool was available: the blending, or plainly speaking just mixing up different batches of the beverage. Lacambre wrote that the brewer's job was a very difficult one as every barrel of lambic possessed its own unique taste[ref:lacambre:348](). To achieve consistent quality, huge experience (and luck) was required, and few brewers were able to do it well.

The blending of lambics apparently led to changing the meaning of the words. Let us remind you that ‘faro’, ‘lambic’, and ‘gueuze’ up until the second half of the 19th century meant the grades of lambic ‘elitism’: faro was less strong and aged less, while gueuze was the high-end quality beer matured for 5 years. But why make several versions of the same beer if you can just mix it up? That's how the late-19th century faro was born, as a blend of lambic with young ‘march’ beer with an addition of sugar for continued fermentation.

With gueuze, the story is even more curious. At some moment, the unknown experimenters had applied the champagnization technology to lambic — as one might guess, the same one used for making sparkling wines. Namely, young lambic was mixed up with an aged one, then the sugar was added and the blend was left maturing in bottles, so carbon dioxide won't leave the reservoir as it happens with barrels. The result exceeded the expectations: the ‘beer champagne’ was not only sparkling, strong, and clear, but also cost a third less than five-year lambic. So at the turn of the century the word gueuze became associated with new, champagne-like blend, and barrel-aged queuze quickly disappeared.

#### How to taste

Lambic is probably the only beer that is nowadays produced exactly as it was made in the 19th, maybe even 18th, century. The Holy Grail for the style lovers is the lambics made by Brasserie Cantillon. Though founded not so long ago, in 1900, Cantillon (the only acting lambic brewery in Brussels) continues to make beer in accordance with the original artisanal technology, including the proverbial pouring wort into shallow tanks to capture the airborne microbiota. It's rather hard to find Cantillon, but that is perhaps the most authentic beer in the world. They don't even use refrigerators and make beer only in proper weather conditions.

Apart from Cantillon, there are several lambic breweries that have even more honorable history:
  * their main rival 3 Fonteinen that was founded in 1883;
  * Girardin and Oud Beersel known from 1882;
  * even older Lindemans Faro and De Troch Lambic (the latter being sold under the brand name ‘Chapeau’) that were first mentioned in the 1820s.

Besides historical enterprises, today lambic is being made by many contemporary Belgian manufacturers and craft breweries alike.

Pure unblended lambic is rarely sold (though it might be found if one really wants it: Cantillon, 3 Fonteinen, and Boon are selling unmixed lambics), and it's usually blends that you might find on sale: faro, gueuze, and the fruit varieties of the latter.

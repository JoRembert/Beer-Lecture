### Not Brewers

Before we continue to the next Belgian beer style, we need to make a journey into a very distant past. Let us remind the reader that in the early Middle Ages king Charlemagne (through the efforts of his heir, king Louis the Pious) promoted the Rule of St Benedict in the lands he controlled. The monks following the Rule were known as ‘the Benedectines’.

However, several centuries later, some theologians began to express their dissatisfaction with the liberties the Brotherhood allowed themselves while following the Rule, and in 1098, the Cistercians emerged — those who followed the Rule of Benedict of Nursia more strictly and obediently.

However, several centuries later some theologians began to express their dissatisfaction with Cistercians being too relaxed in fulfilling their duties. In 1664, the founder of the La Trapp monastery in France, Armand-Jean de Rancé, reformed the way of life in the convent, introducing the most strict rules: mandatory hard physical labor, the vow of silence, harsh diet, and the isolation from the outside world. The Rancé's followers started to call themselves the Cistercians of the Strict Observance, or the Trappists (after the La Trappe monastery).

In 1790, in a course of the French Revolution, monastery property was secularized, and the monasteries in the French territories, including the Trappist ones, were disbanded. Monks initially moved to Switzerland, but during the Napoleon Wars almost all Swiss, Dutch, Belgian, and German convents were disbanded as well, if not destroyed. Friars were able to return to their customary lifestyle only after Bonaparte's fall, when they were allowed to rebuild monasteries — both in France and abroad. La Trappe itself went under the Brotherhood's control in 1815 and was consecrated again in 1832.

During all their history, the Trappists brew their own beer (and made their own cheese) as they were very strict about fasting. So no surprise in that they started to build breweries in all the newly created or restored monasteries. In 1836, the brewery at the **Abbey of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart in Westmalle** was opened; in 1839, at the **St. Sixtus' Abbey in Westvleteren**. Both convents were located in the territories that became parts of the newly created Kingdom of Belgium. During the 19th century, the Trappists built or restored many other monasteries, and several of them started to brew beer. Some share of the output was sold in the vicinity (for example, in 1870, the physicians praised the strong beer from the **Scourmont Abbey in Chimay** for its curative properties)[ref:{"source":{"alias":"brew-like-a-monk","short":"Hieronymus, S. (2005)","extra":["Brew Like a Monk: Trappist, Abbey, and Strong Belgian Ales and How to Brew Them","ISBN 093738187X"]}}:33](); however, the influence of the Trappist brewing (and even more so, the monastic brewing as a whole) in Belgium was negligible. For example, Lacambre didn't mention any abbey beers.

Despite being an isolated community, the monks were nevertheless keeping pace with the technical progress. Particularly, Father Dominic from the **Abbey of Notre-Dame de Saint-Rémy in Rochefort** studied in Leuven, and, at the beginning of the 20th century, even won several medals at the brewing competitions[ref:brew-like-a-monk:36]().

#### The specificities of Belgian prohibition law

Soon, however, the Belgian beer diversity suffered two crushingly hard blows in a row: during the First World War, many breweries were closed, their equipment confiscated, and production banned; after the war, Belgium adopted its prohibition law.

The regulation of 1919 was primarily aimed against *jenever* and other strong alcoholic beverages. It was prohibited to sell them in bars and other public places. Still, the consumption of beer, which was heavily taxed, dropped dramatically. The law was strict, but yet imperfect: it didn't take into account how strong a beer was (probably because a typical Belgian beer from that time had quite modest alcohol content, around 3% ABV). As a consequence, the demand for strong beers (including monastic ones) increased.

In 1922, the monks from Westmalle literally invented a new type of beer which they called ‘dubbel’. It's rather hard to explain this phenomenon — why of all Belgian and world brewers it was monks who defined the new fashion. What they had done is probably more ‘craft’ beer than many contemporary experiments.

Technologically speaking, *dubbel* is a dark beer fermented twice: after the primary fermentation is finished, fresh yeasts and caramel syrup (‘candi sugar’; not to be confused with raw sugar clods that are called ‘candi sugar’ by Americans) are added, and the future beer is bottled for the secondary fermentation. Undisputedly, all the elements taken individually were already known — dark beer, syrup, yeasts, bottle conditioning, etc. — but, as a whole, the process is a unique invention having no direct predecessors.

The result of the refresher yeasts job is a rather strong (initially the strength was around 5% ABV, then it gradually reached 7%), soft, full-bodied, and surprisingly smooth beer — a signature product of Belgian monastic brewing.

#### How to taste

The Abbey of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart continues producing this beer under the ‘Westmalle Dubbel’ brand. Apart from it, six other Trappist monasteries brew *dubbel*:

  * the Scourmont Abbey with ‘Chimay Rouge’ beer;
  * the Abbey of Notre-Dame de Saint-Rémy with ‘Rochefort 6’;
  * the St. Sixtus' Abbey with ‘Westvleteren 8’;
  * the **Koningshoeven Abbey**, under the brand name ‘La Trappe Dubbel’;
  * the **Engelszell Abbey** (‘Stift Engelszell Benno’);
  * and the **Saint Benedictus-Abbey in Achel** with its ‘Achel 8° Bruin’ beer.

Of course, many secular brewers are making *dubbel* as well. First of all, we should mention Pater 6 by St. Bernardus: to this brewery (physically located on the street called Trappistenweg) Westvleteren monks were outsourcing the beer production, and there it was prepared for the monasteries from 1946 to 1992.

Apart from St. Bernardus, we might mention Belgian *dubbel* by Corsendonk (‘Pater’), Duvel Moortgat (‘Maredsous 8 Brune’), Grimbergen, Bornem (‘Double’), Affligem, Petrus, Val-Dieu (‘Brune’), St. Feuillien (‘Brune’). Of course, American craft brewers that specialize in Belgian beers are making it as well: Unibroue (‘Maudite’), Ommegang (‘Abbey Ale’), Allagash, and others.

#### Strict observance

There is a big difference between real Trappist beers and those who imitate it. To have a right to the ‘Authentic Trappist Logo’ sign, three conditions must be fulfilled:

  * the beer is to be brewed within the Trappist monastery walls by monks themselves or under their control;
  * brewing must be a secondary occupation and must not affect the monastic way of living;
  * the venture must not make any profit as any income above the monastery's needs shall go to charity.

The Saint Sixtus' Abbey in Westvleteren even forbids re-selling their beers: they must be bought in the monastery for a fixed price, and there are no labels on the bottles (which, of course, does not stop profiteers from smuggling them; today, the bottles with the recognizable caps might be bought in many large cities). The Westvleteren monks even had a motto: ‘We are not brewers. We are monks. We brew beer to be able to afford being monks’. With time passing, it became more laconic: ‘We brew to live, not live to brew’.

Today, Trappist monks are usually not involved in brewing directly and just control the process. In most monasteries, the head brewer position is occupied by a civilian manager (though it was monks who established the basics — let's say that Father Theodor from Chimay had selected the yeast strains suitable for making monastic beers with his own hand). Still, running a Trappist brewery *implies restrictions*. Jacques Petre, the former head of the Orval brewery, described the contradictions, ‘Before anything happens, you have to explain it to the monks; you have to explain it to the board; you have to explain it to the workers; you have to explain it to everybody. It takes time, and for a monk time doesn’t exist in the way it does for most people’.

When the Trappist beers started to gain popularity, many brewers, both conscientious and not-so-conscientious, started to exploit the monasteries' reluctance to increase the output by marking their beers as ‘Trappist’. The monks, which were always very zealous regarding the quality of the product sold from their name, organized the International Trappist Association in 1997 and set the above-mentioned strict rules for obtaining the ‘Authentic Trappist Product’ logo.

Initially, the Association comprised eight abbeys: Orval, Chimay, Westvleteren, Rochefort, Westmalle and Achel in Belgium, Koningshoeven in the Netherlands (under ‘La Trappe’ trademark), and Mariawald in Germany (the latter had already ceased to produce beer at that moment). Today, there are 20 abbeys in the Association, of which 11 brews the Authentic Trappist beers; apart from the above-mentioned, it's monasteries of Zundert in the Netherlands, Spencer in the United States, Engelszell in Austria, and also the Abbey of Saints Vincent and Anastasius in Italy (makes ‘Tre Fontane’ beers) and the Mount St Bernard Abbey in England (‘Tynt Meadow’ brand). Three more monasteries sell beer but have no rights for the logo: Achel (as the monastery was closed; though, the Abbot of Westmalle comes to Achel once a week to oversee the production), Mont des Cats in France (Chimay produces beers for them) and Cardeña in Spain (the production site is located outside of the monastery, which is disallowed by the rules).

By the way, the Association members also produce many other Trappist products: bread, yeasts, soap, chocolate, cookies, honey, jam, liquors, mushrooms, olive oil, wine, cheese, and many other things, from ceramic jugs to canned quinces from monastery gardens.

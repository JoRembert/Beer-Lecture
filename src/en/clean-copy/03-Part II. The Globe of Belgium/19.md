### Turning Red

The knowledge we have about the third authentic Belgian beer style, the Flanders brown, is even more scattered than data on *lambic* and *saison*, given that the latter is to be gathered bit by bit. The first known mention of the former comes from the recipe omnibus from 1829, and it only tells that the beer was made from barley only that was boiled for a long time (from 15 to 30 hours) to achieve a characteristic brown color[ref:mulder-lost-beers:"A small history of Flemish old brown (and red) – 1"](https://lostbeers.com/a-small-history-of-flemish-old-brown-and-red-1/). The Lacambre's treatise only additionally specifies that the beer was ready to consume only after two or three months of aging[ref:lacambre:312](), which makes the Flanders brown another kind of keeping ale (which in turn implies additional fermentation with ‘bretts’).

Even the 1879 recipe book still just reiterates Lacambre's words; apparently, the Flanders brown was but a local variety of ‘brown’ beer of little interest to the wider public. However, in the 1880s the situation changed dramatically: the style became immensely popular thanks to the efforts of Eugène Rodenbach from Roeselare. After accomplishing training in England, the young Rodenbach became a partner in the family brewery (which belonged to his father, Edward) and refurbished it in an accordance with the latest British fashion. Particularly, he started to leave the beer for additional maturation in large wooden barrels called ‘foeder’-s (often those that previously housed wine, cherry brandy, cognac, or other grape-based alcoholic drinks)[ref:mulder-lost-beers:"A small history of Flemish old brown (and red) – 1"](https://lostbeers.com/a-small-history-of-flemish-old-brown-and-red-1/). Some sources claim the idea was borrowed from the Greene King brewers that are still producing similarly-looking beer[ref:{"source":{"alias":"bailey-pauls-beer","short":"Bailey, P.","extra":["Paul's Beer & Travel Blog"],"href":"https://baileysbeerblog.blogspot.com"}}:"Rodenbach Brewery"](https://baileysbeerblog.blogspot.com/2015/09/rodenbach-brewery.html).

Interestingly, until the 1880s, the Rodenbach beer was considered an *uitzet*, and it most likely became acknowledged as a separate beer style because of Eugène's improvements. The consumers got a taste for that new recipe, and, at the beginning of the 20th century, many local producers started to replicate it. The most successful were the brewers from Oudenaarde: their beers were hailed as equal to wine[ref:mulder-lost-beers:"A small history of Flemish old brown (and red) – 2"](https://lostbeers.com/a-small-history-of-flemish-old-brown-and-red-2/) (an unprecedented compliment to beer!) The beer-makers were using this extensively in their advertisements, even adopting the motto ‘It's wine!’

The Rodenbach beers were and still are made utilizing the following process[ref](http://www.milkthefunk.com/wiki/Flemish_Red-Brown_Beer#Microbes_and_Flavor_Compounds):
  * during the first seven days, the primary fermentation is carried out with the regular baker's yeasts (though the microorganisms package used in the brewery comprises several quite specific S. cerevisiae strains as well as several other species of *Saccharomyces* class and some *Lactobacillus*);
    * unlike *lambics*, the Flanders brown at this stage contains no traces of *Enterobacteria* and acetic acid bacteria, which results in lower acidity;

  * then the future beer is poured into the vessels for secondary fermentation to age for 4 to 5 weeks, during which mostly Lactobacillus are working (in particular, *Lactobacillus delbrueckii* subsp. *bulgaricus* which is used to make yogurts);
  * then it's *foeder* time, when the beer undergoes the classical tertiary fermentation with *Brettanomyces*;
  * the final product is a blend of young and matured beers (other breweries might mix strong beer with a weak one, or with *lambic*).

Though the process of making it closely resembles the making of porter (which actually makes Rodenbach a better approximation of historical porter than modern beverages carrying this name), there are several important differences:
  * the porter-making required a lot of hops, both for speeding up the maturing of the beer and for beating off unpleasant odors of cheap raw materials while the Flemish brewers often use a minimal amount of hops so the resulting bitterness is below the threshold of human perception;
  * malt gets the proper taste, aroma, and dark color with additional boiling for many hours (the tradition rooted in the 18th century at least); the Rodenbachs, in particular, for a long time had been producing the quality malt in their own malting kiln installed in the brewery's grounds.

The resulting beverage is a pretty well-balanced one, with its acidity parameters indeed comparable to wine.

#### How to taste

The legacy of the founding fathers of the Flanders brown is still thriving nowadays. We're talking about two breweries:

  * Rodenbach of Roeselare;
  * Liefmans of Oudenaarde, with their Liefmans Oud Bruin.

Apart from Rodenbach and Liefmans, some other brewers are making the Flanders brown since the 19th century:

  * Brouwerij Roman with their Adriaen Brouwer Audenaerds Bruyn (a truly legendary brewery founded in 1545, and still run by the Roman family);
  * Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste with their Oud Bruin; they also produce another popular (though relatively novel) variety of the style named Cuvée Des Jacobins.

Alongside the historical brewers, there are several modern interpretations of the Flemish classics:

  * Bourgogne des Flandres (made under Timmermans brand owned by John Martin Brewery);
  * Duchesse De Bourgogne by Brouwerij Verhaeghe.

Both names point to Burgundy, thus reminding, first, of the times when Belgium was a part of the Duchy of Burgundy in the 14-16th centuries, and, second, of Burgundian red wines.

And, of course, many craft brewers produce this beer as well; the most popular ones are Americans: The Lost Abbey and Bruery Terreux.

#### What's in my name

If one takes a look at beer labels, one will surely notice that it's usually ‘Flanders red’ (‘rood’), not ‘brown’ (‘bruin’). However, as we can see, in the 19th century it was just ‘brown’, with no other naming. It looks like the beer became ‘red’ simply because the famous writer, the author of ‘The Great Beers of Belgium’, and just a beer enthusiast, Michael Jackson (not to be confused with the famous singer) decided so, and the brewers had no other choice than to follow his lead[ref:mulder-lost-beers:"Flemish brown, red or red brown? How Michael Jackson invented a beer style out of thin air"](https://lostbeers.com/flemish-brown-red-or-red-brown/). The division into ‘red’ and ‘brown’ varieties is now stated in the dictionaries and classifications, though no one can tell for sure what's the difference.

### The Valley of Gold

Alongside Westmalle and Westvleteren, monks were creating beers in another, truly legendary, monastery: the Notre-Dame d'Orval Abbey in the Belgian province of Luxembourg. According to a legend, the name ‘Orval’ and the land's coat of arms ascend to Queen Mathilda of Tuscany who accidentally dropped her wedding ring in a local spring; as the queen had recently been widowed, she was grieving about the loss of the ring a lot and kept praying to the God — and then a trout appeared, bearing the ring in its mouth. ‘It's truly *the valley of gold*’, the gladdened queen exclaimed (‘Val d'Or’ in French), and decided to found a monastery there. In commemoration of this legend, both monastery's coat of arms and the label of the beer that is made there feature a trout bearing a ring in its mouth.

Throughout almost a thousand years of history, Orval was a home for the Benedictines (that came from Calabria in 1070), the Cistercians (that settled there in 1132), and the Trappists as well. The monastery was burned down thrice (in 1252, 1637, and 1793) and remained in ruins for a long time until finally the land was given to the Trappists in 1926. Soon the new building was erected — with a brewery, as one might have guessed. The first chief brewer, Martin Pappenheimer, came from Germany, and his assistant, John Vanhuele, from East Flanders (and in addition, he worked a lot in England). Together, they created a truly miraculous beer in 1932: today we would call it a ‘fusion’ of all those traditions, enhanced with the latest Westmalle friars' developments. Unlike other beers, Orval was never a subject of a legend claiming it derived from some ancient recipes, as such recipes simply do not exist.

Ingredients needed to make Orval comprise five types of malt and classical Styrian Goldings and Hallertau hops. The beer is to be fermented thrice: first, the regular warm fermentation for five days; then, a package of fresh yeasts (a mix of baker's yeasts and *Brettanomyces*) and more hops are added, to ferment for another three weeks; finally, before the beer is bottled, sugar syrup and more yeasts are put there to work for yet another month — which is a clear homage to *saison* (see the ‘March’ chapter), probably, introduced by Vanhuele.

What is even more remarkable, it's not the ingredients that define the spirit of Orval — it's the Orval spirit that defines the ingredients to use. Jean-Marie Rock who was a technical director at Orval for 28 years told that each year he, similarly to what Michelin chefs do, tasted the grain samples of the new harvest to select those that will be used to recreate *that* taste.

‘Bretts’ (which are by the way ‘local’, gathered in the Orval valley) comprise a small share of the yeast package that is added during secondary and tertiary fermentations, but their effect is a long-playing one. Orval is usually considered to be fully ready to be consumed in nine months after bottling, after the *Brettanomyces* have finished their job[ref:brew-like-a-monk:54-55]() (in our experience, that's not enough: it requires several years to fully develop the Orval flavor).

#### How to taste

For a long time, Orval was considered just a Belgian strong pale ale despite having little in common with other beers of that kind. The only attempt to replicate the recipe was made by craft brewers from Mikkeler who released the mockingly-named ‘Årh Hvad?!’ beer (later renamed to ‘Hva Såå?!’); the author of this book might testify that the copy was easily distinguished from the original by look alone, to say nothing about the taste.

Recently, however, a notable amount of ‘Orval-like’ beers emerged, and louder became the voices of those who propose to name Orval a beer style in its own right[ref:{"source":{"alias":"boak-and-bailey","short":"Boak & Bailey's Beer Blog","href":"https://boakandbailey.com/"}}:"Hoover, Google, Orval?"](https://boakandbailey.com/2018/03/hoover-google-orval/) — which we hope will soon happen. There is a special [‘orval-clone’ tag](https://www.ratebeer.com/tag/orval-clone/) on Ratebeer for these beers.

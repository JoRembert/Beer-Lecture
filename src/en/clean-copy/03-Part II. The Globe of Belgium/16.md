### White, Yellow, Brown

And still: what did 19th-century Belgians drink exactly? Certainly, it's very hard to categorize 15 thousand beers, but we may try to highlight some trends and summarize common knowledge. From the parliamentary documents from that time (which were, of course, discussing taxation nuances), we might compile the following table with the prices for the most common beer types[ref:mulder-lost-beers:"Beer riots in 19th century Brussels"](https://lostbeers.com/beer-riots-in-19th-century-brussels/):

| Beer style               | Price, centimes per glass |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Bavière                  | 18,00 / 18,57 |
| White (of Leuven)        | 8,83 / 9,50 |
| Brown                    | 10,34 / 10,72 |
| Brown (of Diest)         | 9,00 |
| Faro                     | 12,00 / 12,00 |
| Hoegaarden               | 8,50 / 9,00 |
| Yellow                   | 7,53 / 7,51 |
| Lambic                   | 15,67 / 16,00 |
| Mars                     | 7,50 / 9,00 |
| Peeterman                | 10,00 / 10,00 |
| Uitzet                   | 10,40 / 11,50 |

The first number stands for a price of a mug of beer in regions where no local taxes on beer imports (‘octrois’) existed, while the second is for regions where there were some.

‘Bavière’ means ‘Bavaria’ in French, e.g. German lagers. As you can see, it was a very expensive beer and common folk couldn't afford it.

Other beers might be rather unappetizingly split into three large categories:

  * ‘white’ beers (e.g. brewed from wind-dried malt and unmalted wheat) that we described in the previous chapter; two main ‘white’ varieties were Leuven and Hoegaarden ones, with Peeterman being closely related to them;
  * ‘yellow’ beers (e.g. a bit darker than ‘white’, usually with a large proportion of wheat in the grist); the most widespread (and cheap) category of beer, plainly speaking, just regular pale beers (Belgium was one of the most prominent coal suppliers in Europe those times, so making pale malts was not a problem) brewed by small local manufacturers; Faro, Lambic, and Mars were considered ‘yellow’ as well;
  * ‘brown’ (e.g. dark) beers, being represented here as simply ‘brown’ and two of its local varieties: one from Ghent (‘uitzet’) and one from Diest.

#### The Full Treatise

In 1851, Georges Lacambre, a French engineer and a Belgian brewer, issued a rather large (more than 500 pages) book named ‘Full Treatise on Brewing Beer and Distillation of Grains’, which we might without any doubt call the study book for any Belgian brewing tradition researcher. Among many other things, it features detailed recipes of Belgian beers of that period. 

It's not that easy to get the text (it exists in a scanned form[ref:{"source":{"alias":"lacambre","short":"Lacambre, G. (1851)","extra":"Traité complet de la fabrication des bières et de la distillation des grains, pommes de terre, vins, betteraves, mélasses, etc.","href":"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Trait%C3%A9_complet_de_la_fabrication_des_bi/yBQTAAAAQAAJ"}}](), but the French text is not digitized), but the book totally worth it as it provides full and complete articles on brewing techniques, and also wondrous descriptions of bizarre Belgian eclectics.

Lacambre (who, let us remind you, was a French engineer, and, furthermore, an apt adopter of German and English technological advancements) describes several important features of Belgian brewing:

  * a huge amount of different regional beer styles and their varieties;
  * extensive use of wheat (he estimated that three-quarters of Belgian beer industry output was brewed with wheat) and other cereals:
      * beer from 100% barley was rather a novelty; for example, in the chapter dedicated to Leuven, Lacambre points out (with a certain degree of boasting) that the only Leuven brewery capable of producing beer from pure barley was Lacambre's own installation built ‘several years ago’, and other brewers don't possess technical means of doing so;
      * disregard the fact that the author clearly considers all-barley beer being more technologically advanced, he still admits that wheat beer sometimes has ‘more palatable taste than the barley one, especially served fresh or young’ and that it even ‘reaches the subtlety of wine’;
  * Belgian artisanal brewing is quite rational but rather unproductive.

Fun Fact. According to Lacambre, many Belgian beers, including, let's say, Lambic and white of Leuven, had been degraded more than 30 years before the book was written, and in the Lacambre times (the book was issued in 1851) they were already brewed negligently. The final section of the book is dedicated mainly to criticizing Belgian laws that led to the deterioration of the industry ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.

#### How to taste

Out of all these beers, three kinds survived the 20th century (furthermore, being almost intact): lambics (‘Faro’ and ‘Lambic’ itself), saisons (a subtype of ‘Mars’), and Flemish brown. We will dedicate a separate chapter to each of them.

All other thousands of beer styles were lost, alas, to no surprise: the process of making any traditional Belgian beer involved several dozens of manual artisanal procedures: germinate the malt to three quarters, dry until it gets amber color, get rid of rootlets, leave it in the open air for three-four days to absorb some moist, lay a 2-3 inch layer of wheat husks on the floor of the mashing tun, strain the wort through the false bottom, and so on, and on, and on. Of course, only the geek-reenactors are following those instructions nowadays — and, fortunately, in the 21st century, we've got some! News regarding re-creating some historical beers comes not every day of course, but still quite regularly. We know about five reconstructions claiming to reproduce old recipes more or less precisely.

  1. Peeterman, a thicker and darker ‘honey’ variety of Leuven ‘white’ (‘Peeterman’, meaning ‘men of Peter’, was a nickname of the citizens of Leuven, the main square of which hosts the St. Peter's Church), being traditionally brewed with wind-dried barley malt and unmalted wheat[ref:pattinson-shut-up:"Brewing in Leuven in the 1830's"](http://barclayperkins.blogspot.com/2009/05/brewing-in-leuven-in-1830s.html). Today, *peeterman* is produced by the Breda brewery from Leuven.

      (A sad story: Leuven is the birthplace of the Artois company that eventually evolved into the world's largest beer producer, AB InBev, headquarters of which are still located in Leuven. Peeterman was a signature Artois beer for many decades. However, the world's flagship brewer discontinued the Peeterman production without breaking a sweat.)

  2. Uitzet, a ‘brown’ beer from East Flanders region; in 1798, a Ghent doctor named Wauters wrote a whole treatise on this beer, claiming that *uitzet* was invented in Wetteren in 1730, that it had a very clear yellow-brown color, and that in 1791 it saved people of the town from the dysentery epidemic being extremely simple and healthy drink[ref:mulder-lost-beers:"Lost Belgian beers: Uitzet"](https://lostbeers.com/lost-belgian-beers-uitzet/).

      Today, *uitzet* is produced by the Paeleman brewery in once-saved Wetteren.

  3. Seef, a ‘white’ beer from Anwerp, which was once so popular that one of the city districts is named after it[ref:mulder-lost-beers:"A recipe for Antwerp seef"](https://lostbeers.com/a-recipe-for-antwerp-seef/).

      Production was reinstated by Johan Van Dyck, a beer enthusiast and coincidentally then a marketing specialist at Duvel Moortgat brewery, and is now being sold under the ‘Seefbier by Antwerpse Brouw Compagnie’ brand. Oats and buckwheat are included in the recipe as they should be.

  4. Jack-Op, a blended beer that was produced by mixing ‘brown’ beer with Lambic. It enjoyed huge success at the end of the 19th century, and at the beginning of the 21st one the manufacturing was restored by Frank Boon and is being produced by the brewery of the same name[ref:mulder-lost-beers:"Five ‘lost’ Belgian beer brands that came back on the market"](https://lostbeers.com/five-lost-belgian-beer-brands-that-came-back-on-the-market/).

  5. Zoeg, a pale sweet beer that *almost* survived the 20th century (it was produced in Tienen until 1955). Three of the five brewery founders were medics, so the beer was known as ‘the doctors' beer’; according to a local legend, the doctors were rather excessive drinkers so the logo featured a pig[ref:{"short":"Mattheus, M. (2013)","extra":"De Zoeg, een heel apart verhaal"}](). In 2010, the beer production was resumed by a Tienen entrepreneur, Miel Mattheus, and is now being sold as ‘Zoeg Tienen’ by Brouwerij De Vlier.

(It actually might be that there are much more historically-precise reconstructions than these five: at least a dozen of other beers are said to be recreated after authentic recipes. The author of this book leans toward considering them all free fantasies on historical themes — and might well be wrong as it's usually not that simple to check such claims.)

    Beer. The most modest and unassuming beverage, a filler for supermarket
    shelves. At the same timeâ€”a staple of the economies of many nations for
    millennia. Egyptian pyramid builders were paid with it, polar explorers took
    it to the North Pole as a life-sustaining product, workers of Brussels once
    rioted because its price was up by two centimes.

    In this book, a centuries-long beer history is told in a comprehensive,
    interesting, and *practical* manner. You will learn which beer styles were
    popular in each epoch, from Bronze Age to the 21st century, understand the
    reasons behind this popularity, and most importantly, explore the history by
    taste.

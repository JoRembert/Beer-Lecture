### The 4 C's

Right after the American interpretation of British pale ale was born, Sierra Nevada Brewing Company made an American IPA as well — stronger, more bitter and more aromatic. The craft movement got its own signature: a love for immensely bitter and fragrant hop beverages. In the 90s, almost every brewery made a practice of brewing at least one IPA, and the most innovative ones got much further than this: ‘Belgian API’ emerged (fermented with Belgian yeast strains), then ‘Black IPA’ (made from darker malt), and also ‘double’, ‘triple’, and ‘imperial’ Indian pale ales. In 1999, IPAs already constituted the majority of beers at the Great American Beer Festival (maybe even earlier as we haven't found prior records).

Some researchers tell about the ‘Four C's Revolution’: after Cascade, in the 80s and 90s, Chinook, Columbus, and Centennial hit the market (the latter was even advertised as ‘Super-Cascade’). The proportion of alpha acids and essential oils broke Cascade's record with more than a double margin. But it was still not enough for modern horticulturalists as many new hop varieties demonstrate even more impressive numbers[ref](http://www.hopslist.com).

| Hop Variety | Alpha acids | Beta acids | Essential oils, in 100 g |
|-------------|------------:|-----------:|-----------:|
| Cascade     | 4,5-8,9%    | 3,6-7,5%   | 0,8-1,5 ml |
| Centennial  | 9,5%-11,5%  | 3,5%-4,5%  | 1,5-2,5 ml |
| Chinook     | 12%-14%     | 3%-4%      | 1,5-2,7 ml |
| Columbus    | 14%-18%     | 4,5%-6%    | 1,5-4,5 ml |
| Citra       | 10%-15%     | 3%-4,5%    | 1,5-3,0 ml |
| Amarillo    | 8%-11%      | 6%-7%      | 1,5-1,9 ml |
| Mosaic      | 11,5%-13,5% | 3,2%-3,9%  | 1,0-1,5 ml |
| Apollo      | 15%-20%     | 5,5%-8%    | 1,5-2,5 ml |

But it's not only about increasing the alpha acids and essential oils content: soon plant breeders started to search for varieties featuring specific flavors. Depending on which exactly essential oils are dominating, hops will have different aroma:
  * caryophyllenes give a ‘herbal’ and ‘spicy’ smell and taste;
  * myrcene — pine, citrus, fruit;
  * farnesene — fresh green, woody;
  * geraniol — flowers, berries;
  * etc.

Though one might easily create one's own classification, usually around 10 different hop flavors are differentiated[ref](https://beermaverick.com/the-science-behind-identifying-hop-aromas/):

| Flavor              | Example hops                   |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| Citrus              | Cascade, Centennial, Amarillo, Citra, Simcoe, Galaxy |
| Tropical fruit      | Mosaic, Idaho 7, Azacca, Citra, Simcoe, El Dorado |
| Stone fruit         | Idaho 7, Eureka |
| Berries             | Nelson Sauvin, Simcoe |
| Floral              | Cascade, Centennial, Ella |
| Resin / Pine        | Centennial, Chinook, Mosaic, Saaz |
| Herbal              | Sabro, Nugget, Columbus, Hallertau, Ekuanot |
| Spice               | Columbus, Chinook, Magnum, Saaz, Hallertau |

Some hop varieties are bred on purpose bearing some very specific (and sometimes exotic) aroma in mind. For example, Nelson Sauvin has ‘vinous’ taste (or more precisely, the taste of Sauvignon Blanc grapes) and Sorachi Ace, the matcha one. Others were created to encompass the entire palette of different flavors in one hop cone — examples include Sabro, Apollo, and Mosaic.

#### How to taste

The most convenient approach to understanding the impact the chosen hops made on beer taste is tasting several ‘Single Hop’ beers from one series. This implies the brewery makes several identical beers that differ only in hops. For example, the Mikkeler ‘Single Hop’ series comprises almost a dozen of different kinds of hops. Such sets are also featured by Hill Farmstead (‘Single Hop Pale Ale’), Toppling Goliath (‘Pseudo Sue’), Flying Dog (‘Imperial IPA Single Hop’), De Molen (‘Single Hop’), and Sierra Nevada (‘Single Hop’).

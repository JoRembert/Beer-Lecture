### The Revitalisation

Though Maytag was bearing the banner of the craft revolution all alone, many others were as well worried about the problem of protecting local brewers from extinction. If the United States had almost nothing to lose but Anchor Brewing Company, the Europeans still got some.

We assume nobody will be surprised by the fact that the European wing of the revolution was led by the Brits. On March 16, 1971, four young admirers of good ale — Michael Hardman, Graham Lees, Jim Makin, and Bill Mellor — gathered together in the Kruger's Bar, Dunquin, Ireland and founded one of the most influential consumer organizations in history: Campaign for the Revitalisation of Ale aka CAMRA. (Fortunately, they have soon decided to replace the cumbersome ‘revitalisation of ale’ with just ‘real ale’, provided it makes the same abbreviature but spares a lot of letters. So ‘CAMRA’ now stands for ‘Campaign for Real Ale’.) The goals of the Campaign were named: preserving and long-term development of real ale (and later — cider and perry as well) and pubs as a part of the cultural heritage of the United Kingdom. Starting the next year, in 1972, the Campaign started to issue its own magazine (‘What's brewing’), and, in 1974, its own book (‘The Good Beer Guide’). From 1977 on, the Great British Beer Festival is being held.

The impact CAMRA had on the British (and even global) industry of brewing is hard to underestimate. The Campaign become highly popular immediately (got five thousand members in just two first years), and soon turned into a power to be reckoned with. It was CAMRA that pushed the adoption of the so-called Beer Orders (formally, ‘Supply of Beer Order 1989’) to break down the oligopoly of the six main beer producers (which we described in the previous chapter) that controlled almost all pubs in the country, thus making it complicated for the smaller competitors to get on tap.

The ‘real ale’ from the CAMRA's point of view must be ‘live’, e.g. contain enough yeasts and sugars to continue fermenting in a vessel it's stored in. Most notable ‘real ales’ are ‘cask’-conditioned ones (e.g. kept in a small ‘cask’ barrel) at the normal atmosphere pressure (e.g. the exceed carbon dioxide is evaporated): those cask ales are considered the true ones[ref](https://camra.org.uk/learn-discover/the-basics/what-is-live-beer/).

#### How to taste

Ideally — go to the UK, find a bar that participates in the Campaign (fortunately, today it's not a problem at all), and have a pint of fresh cask ale. Meanwhile, CAMRA is preserving not only beer (and cider, and perry) but also authentic bar interiors. All these treasuries (both bars and interiors) are listed in the Good Beer Guide that the Campaign issues (also available in the app)[ref](https://camra.org.uk/about/publications/the-good-beer-guide/).

If you can't go to the UK, you might try ‘real ale’ in a bottle, as CAMRA also bestows the ‘Champion Beer of Britain’ ward. The list of the champions might be found [there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champion_Beer_of_Britain); let us just point out the most admired ones:
  * the multiple-times winner in almost every category, Fuller's with its flagship ‘London Pride’, ‘ESB’, ‘1845’, ‘Vintage Ale’ beers;
  * Green King with its ‘Old Speckled Hen’, ‘Abbot Ale’, ‘Olde Suffolk’, ‘IPA’ beers;
  * Harviestoun — Old Engine Oil, Ola Dubh;
  * Adnams — Broadside, Ghost Ship, SSB;
  * Orkney — Skull Splitter, Dark Island;
  * Oackham — Citra, Green Devil IPA, Jeffrey Hudson Bitter;
  * Caledonian — Deuchars IPA, McEwan's India Pale Ale, John Courage Amber.

  Let us also note that ‘real ale’ is not a beer style but rather a set of rules on making and storing beers. CAMRA names 12 basic British beer styles, and a lot of sub-kinds to each of them — of every taste, color, and aroma.

### The Alchemist from Vermont

Beer is a democratic beverage: we have never heard ecstatic stories about the finest harvest of 1967 used to make a single batch of beer, each bottle worth 10 thousand euros (but don't let them deceive you: only the barley from the southern slope counts). Yes, there are rare and hard-to-reach beers like Westvleteren or Cantillon; however, first, you might find them for something like 20 euros if you try hard enough, and, second, to be frank, craft varieties of the same beers are hardly worse than the originals. In the 80s, it was, of course, much more complicated, and one needed to go to Belgium and reach remote monasteries by bike, but in the 21st century, in every big city, one might get literally everything one wants.

And that makes the story that happened right before our eyes in the backwater town of Waterbury, Vermont, even more fascinating. In 2003, John and Jen Kimmich opened there a small bar named ‘The Alchemist’ and a brewery at it. For his bar, John was making a special IPA he called ‘Heady Topper’. Brews were not regular — just two times a year. Then three times. Then four.

The Kimmichs never advertised Heady Topper and didn't care about marketing. However, they soon found patrons were making lines outside of their bar. Beer lovers from all across the country were heading to Vermont to try this beer and then tell everyone about it. Furthermore, some of the buyers were secretly pouring the beer into bottles to re-sell it at an exorbitant price.

In 2011, John convinced Jen to start selling Heady Topper in cans and installed a small packaging line. (Ironically, the same week, Tropical Storm Irene washed the pub away.) In the first year the output increased four times; next year, another six. In 2013, Heady Topper stormed the BeerAdvocate rating, ending the year in 4th place, and since then never left the top 5[ref:{"short":"Riches, S.

But what was the alchemy that John Kimmich was making in this small Vermont pub? He actually did the following: brewed a double IPA with hops not being used for bitterness, but for aroma taste only. And yes, he had to apply a lot of magic! Heating wort with hops needs to be totally avoided, dry hopping applied multiple times, and special hops selected to balance flavors.

This beer style is now known under many names: Vermont IPA, NE IPA (NE = New England, a region that includes Vermont), East Coast IPA (opposing the West Coast there California with its classical American IPAs is located), DDH IPA (‘Double Dry Hopped’); also ‘hazy’ or ‘juicy’ IPA — because of the best examples of the style, including the Heady Topper one, featuring mostly tropical juice aroma; there is (usually) no real juice in the recipe. And the ‘hazy’ adjective is the result of the general cloudiness and opaqueness of the drink.

For a long time, classifiers failed to recognize NE IPA as a beer style in its own right. The dam got busted in 2018 when the Great American Beer Festival organizers finally introduced separate ‘juice or hazy’ pale ale categories — which immediately dislodged the traditional IPAs as the most popular beer style by the number of entrants.

#### How to taste

Ideally — find the very Heady Topper (or other beer in this style from The Alchemist named ‘Focal Banger’), but that's still quite complicated. Among the US brewers, Hill Farmstead, Tree House, and Trillium are considered experts in making superb Vermont-style ales.

Other beers marked as ‘NE IPA’ shall be treated with a certain degree of incredulity, as many ‘NE IPA’-marked beers are just regular IPAs, thanks to the immense popularity of the style and the complexity of producing a proper product. The ‘DDH’ mark is usually more reliable, as double dry hopping at least guarantees the rich aroma and flavor. In general, there is no such question as ‘how to distinguish NE IPA from IPA’: proper NE IPA should be hardly distinguishable in its appearance from orange or pineapple juice.

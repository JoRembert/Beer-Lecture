### The Red Triangle
##### Historical period: the 19th century CE
##### Scene of action: Burton upon Trent

While the beer trade in the Baltics was stagnating, another prospective market was growing at a faster pace: ‘The Jewel in the Crown’, e.g. India. First beer shipments to Madras and other colonies were already mentioned at the beginning of the 18th century. Closer to the end of the century, however, all the trade was monopolized by a single London brewer named Hodgson. The brewery he owned, called ‘Bow Brewery’, which was not even on the London top-ten beer producers list, was quite fortunately located next to East India Trading Company headquarters. Hodgson pulled some strings, offered Company's captains an 18-months credit line — and became an exclusive beer supplier for India[ref:amber-gold-black:101](). The trade volumes grew fivefold from 1775 to 1800 — from 240 thousand liters to 1.3 million.

Meanwhile, Burton brewing industry at the beginning of the 19th century was stagnating. Just one brewery was opened from 1803 to 1827[ref:brewing-in-burton:27](). However, in 1821, the wind of change reversed its direction, to Burtoners greater glory. The East India Company got tired of Hodgson and his dubious practices of doing business and brewing beer alike — and approached Burton's leading brewer, Samuel Allsopp, offering the possibility to start Indian trade. Soon, another two Burton brewers joined Allsopp, namely Bass and Salt. Hodgson tried to counter-attack but his ale was of no quality to compete, and soon the market fell into Burtoners' hands almost entirely[ref:amber-gold-black:107](). In 1830, William Worthington also entered the market.

Initially, in the 18th century, the most common types of beer were shipped to India: pale ale, porter, Burton ale, and even ‘table beer’. Hodson was a porter producer (and porter was actually a standard drink for soldiers and petty officers, and was supplied in great quantities to military garrisons, including those based in India[ref:zythophile:"More IPA myths that must die on #IPADay"](https://zythophile.co.uk/2012/08/02/more-ipa-myths-that-must-die-on-ipaday/)). However, dark beers were considered to be too heavy for a tropical climate while low-alcohol and slightly-hopped beers frequently were not surviving the long voyage. So Hodgson was shipping first of all his strongly hopped pale ale, and it was this beer that was brewed by Allsopp (according to the legend, in a teapot) when the Chairman Marjoribanks of the East India Company asked him to replicate the best Hodgson's recipe. Let us remind you about the qualities of Burton water that allowed for even more pale and sparkling pale ales.

Fun Fact. Marjoribanks approached not London porter brewers but Allsopp because Burtoners had got the expertise in long-distance ale shipping. As for Burton pale ales being so good, that's a bit of pure luck for us.

During the first five decades, nobody bothered to invent a designation for this product. Up until the end of the 1830s, there was *no specific name* for India-oriented beers, it was just ‘beer’[ref:steele-ipa:"3":](). However, this style was slowly gaining such descriptions as ‘pale ale prepared for East and West India climate’, ‘pale ale brewed for Indian market’, and so on, to denote its export qualities. Starting from the 1850s, instead of these bulky constructs, the phrase ‘India Pale Ale’ prevailed. It looks like it was directly related to the extending railroad network to Burton in 1839. Bass and Allsopp shifted their focus to domestic sales and started to advertise their product extensively. Hodgson was not lagging behind as well: in 1844, his IPA was marketed as ‘having an excellent reputation in India for more than a century’ (sic). Shortly after, the IPA sales within Britain excessed Indian exports and IPA gradually became a beer for domestic consumption, a status drink for middle and upper classes[ref:amber-gold-black:115]().

Beer Myth. There is a beautiful legend, voiced in 1869 by Walter Molyneaux, a contemporary of the events, about a ship that wrecked near the British coast with its cargo of IPA later sold in Liverpool by the insurers; it is told that the commoners got a taste for the ale, and started seeking to buy it in large quantities. Though the part about the shipwreck turned out to be true (though Molino was mistaken about the dates), the connection of the IPA popularity growth to the event is rather doubtful[ref:zythophile:"The IPA shipwreck and the Night of the Big Wind"](https://zythophile.co.uk/2015/10/12/the-ipa-shipwreck-and-the-night-of-the-big-wind/).

The most prominent Burton brewer, William Bass, had created the first truly global beer brand. In 1887, at the peak of its fame, the Bass Brewery produced 150 million liters of beer in a year.

You might judge how popular Bass Pale Ale was by the fact it was depicted by several leading painters of the time, most notably in ‘A Bar at the Folies-Bergère’ by Édouard Manet. In this picture, there are two easily noticeable bottles with the red triangle; this is the famous logo of the Bass Brewery. Also, it's the first registered trademark in Britain: it is said that William Bass had sent a clerk overnight to be the first on the queue the day the bureau opened, as Bass' company was suffering from treacherous competitors selling low-quality beer stamped with the red triangle[ref:zythophile:"The Bass red triangle: things AB-InBev won’t tell you"](https://zythophile.co.uk/2013/06/28/the-bass-red-triangle-things-ab-inbev-wont-tell-you/).

#### The bitter confusion

Let us note that no difference between ‘Indian Pale Ale’ and just ‘Pale Ale’ existed up until the second half of the 19th century. In particular, Bass Pale Ale was the canonical IPA that actually gave the style its fame. Many beer producers, noticing the growing popularity of ‘Ale for India’, were rebranding their most expensive pale stock ales as ‘IPA’[ref:amber-gold-black:114](). Beer marked as ‘Pale Ale’ even in the second half of the century still had an impressive bitterness of 60-80 IBU[ref:pattinson-shut-up:"Defining Pale Ale"](http://barclayperkins.blogspot.com/2021/09/defining-pale-ale.html) (see below).

All those (I)PAs were stock ales meaning they were aged for 4-12 months or even more and secondary fermented with the *Brettanomyces*. However, with the growing popularity of the style and further technical progress, British brewers started to produce ‘mild’ (e.g. unaged) versions by adding invert sugar (also, corn flakes and other additives) to wort and additionally refining it. This ale was denoted with the abbreviation ‘AK’ (sometimes, ‘KK’) and was sold in casks as fresh as possible[ref:pattinson-shut-up:"What was AK"](http://barclayperkins.blogspot.com/2021/06/what-was-ak.html) — in fact, it's exactly the thing that we now call a ‘real ale’ (see the ‘Revitalisation’ chapter).

Fun Fact. Martin Cornell suggests that the letters ‘AK’ might mean ‘Ankel Koyt’ (‘single koyt’), therefore being an artifact of that epoch when the Dutch expats were brewing hopped beer in Britain[ref:amber-gold-black:17]() (see the ‘Word on Hops’ and ‘Barrels and Bretts’ chapters).

Consumers, however, had adopted neither of the terms: pub patrons called these beers just ‘bitters’. As a result, four different designations of the same style emerged:
  * Indian pale ale (British style);
  * pale ale (British style);
  * bitter;
  * extra-strong bitter, or ESB.

Most classifications are currently identifying them as four different beer styles, though, in fact, they are just subtypes of the ‘AK’ beer, slightly varying in bitterness and alcohol content.

#### How to taste

Finding an ‘AK’ is not a problem, as it's just a classical British ale. Out of breweries that had made it through the 20th century we might note American Ballantine Indian Pale Ale and British Worthington's White Shield (the latter still brewed in Burton). In general, British bitters got quite a characteristic taste and are now produced in numbers by fine breweries — let us mention Fuller's, Adnams, Thornbridge, Greene King, Samuel Smith, Harviestoun, Marston's.

Tasting a ‘real’ IPA, the one that Hodgson and Allsopp shipped to India, is unfortunately not possible. To begin with, we have no idea what they were actually shipping. Out of four original East India Company suppliers (namely, Hodgson, Allsopp, Bass, and Salt), none have survived. The Bass trademark was bought by AB InBev, and the Bass Pale Ale continues to be produced (under the pretentious ‘Bass Trademark No. 1 Ale’ name) with the red triangle being redesigned beyond any recognition; however, it has nothing to do with the original Bass, and, furthermore, the beer itself is quite mediocre.

Craft brewers make some aged intensively hopped stock ales that should be very much like the real IPAs. That's for example, Brett IPA by Allagash and Enjoy After Brett IPA by Stone.

#### Bitterness Units

Bitterness of beer might be measured. There are two main scales: international (IBU, International Bitterness Units) and European (EBU, European Bitterness Units). Beer with less than 30 IBUs is usually considered not bitter at all (though an English man of the 15th century wouldn't agree with that). Beer with 60 or more IBUs is definitely bitter, and many people will not like it (pale ale at this level of bitterness should be called an IPA). In the 30 to 60 range, every producer is free to decide whether to mark the beer as a pale ale, a bitter, or maybe an IPA as well.

Thicker and stronger beers conceal bitterness. Imperial stouts (see the next chapter) might easily have IBU 100, but it's hard to tell they did. Reaching more than IBU 100 is possible but makes no sense as humans can't sense it.

European bitterness scale theoretically should coincide with the international one. However, because of some technicalities, it's usually slightly lower.

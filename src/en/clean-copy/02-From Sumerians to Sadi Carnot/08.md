### The Beer of the Industrial Revolution
##### Historical period: the 18th century CE
##### Scene of action: London

At the end of the 17th century CE, all the prerequisites for the industrialization of brewing in England were in place. Chaotic and semi-professional ale producers were superseded by organized, commercially-minded beer brewers. There were more than 17 thousand licensed drinking premises in the country (one per 183 inhabitants)[ref:meussdoerffer-history:22](), and the beer business comprised 28% per of GDP[ref:{"source":{"alias":"steele-ipa","short":"Steele, M. (2012)","extra":"IPA: Brewing Techniques, Recipes, and the Evolution of India Pale Ale"}}:"2":]() — however, no real *industry* existed: beer was consumed on-premise in those thousands of alehouses.

The impetus that catalyzed the industrialization came in a form of an excise tax turmoil. England entered the Nine Years' War of 1688-1697 and in a search of additional funding the government, exquisitely as hell, created a total mess with taxation, raising beer levies dramatically[ref:change-is-brewing:194](). Brewers were forced to seek ‘optimizing’ the taxes and soon found the loophole: from the legal point of view, there were ‘strong’ and ‘week’ beers, but the exact alcoholic content was not prescribed. So to ease the tax burden, one could brew a batch of very strong beer, pay the levies, and then dilute it with weak beer. This beverage prepared for future blending was called ‘double’, ‘three-threads’, or ‘stout’ (meaning ‘hard’) beer. As a result, clandestine mixing of the semi-products to get a ready-to-use consumer product became a widespread practice among tavern keepers[ref:change-is-brewing:219-226]().

Beer Myth. It's often said that the ‘three-thread’ beer was a blend of three kinds of beer: stale, fresh, and pale. This is probably just an urban myth: ‘three-threads’ was just a mix of keeping and running ales[ref:zythophile:"The three-threads mystery and the birth of porter: the answer is …"](https://zythophile.co.uk/2015/06/05/the-three-threads-mystery-and-the-birth-of-porter-the-answer-is/). Still, mixing up just two threads was nevertheless hard (and dangerous) job for tavern keepers.

In the end, the beer production dropped, and the collected tax sums became even smaller than before (partially, that was because of ‘gray’ schemes, of course, but the overall beer consumption still decreased significantly). In order to overcome the illicit stout blending, lawmakers introduced an additional levy on malt itself, which led to further degradation of the industry[ref:change-is-brewing:228]().

These hide-and-seek games with the government were finally resolved at the beginning of the 18th century in the most progressive manner: some nameless innovators started to brew a beverage called ‘entire-butt’ (or rather ‘intire-butt’ as they spelled it those days), e.g. ‘the full barrel’. To make this beer, all four or five worts prepared from one batch of grain (in this case, the cheapest ‘brown’ malt) were mixed back, intensively hopped, and then aged for some time in a large barrel (which was called ‘butt’).

There were other innovations: the inventors of that new beer were the first who approached the beer production with an engineer's pedantry to control *precisely* how the product is prepared. In particular, they started drying malt implying a specific temperature profile instead of just leaving it in a kiln for several days: the heat was gradually increasing, giving the sharp rise at the very end of the process, to make malt ‘pop’ like popcorn (this type of malt was conversely called ‘blown’[ref](https://brewingbeerthehardway.wordpress.com/2017/12/27/blown-vs-brown-malt/)). Wort made from this malt might ferment at a higher temperature meaning it was less likely to turn sour and was fit to be brewed in summer. As this beer got spoiled less frequently and generally became less capricious, the sizes of ‘butt’-barrels began to increase thus allowing for scaling the production. This product was ready-to-use, no need to mix it with anything, and — the most important part! — it cost half-penny less than analogous blended beers[ref:amber-gold-black:55]().

Interestingly, first 80 or so years this beer was called just ‘entire-butt’, but finally another naming prevailed: *porter*. This beverage was so enormously popular among port workers that *porter* (initially just a euphemism) superseded other names. One scholar claims that porter consumption provided 2000 calories per day for an average London port worker in the 18th century[ref:zythophile:"The forgotten story of London’s porters"](http://zythophile.co.uk/2007/11/02/the-forgotten-story-of-londons-porters/)!

Basically, the earliest porters were pseudo-‘keeping ales’ made from the cheapest malt with the lack of alcohol (typical ‘old ale’ was stronger) being compensated by adding hops in abundance. The scheme worked because lawmakers somehow overlooked the possibility of putting excises on hops as well[ref:{"short":"Anderson, R. (2003)","extra":["Microbes and the Origins of Porter","Brewery History, 113, pp. 27-30"]}](http://www.breweryhistory.com/journal/archive/113/bh-113-027.html). Brown malt was cheap because it was dried in a wood kiln (thus absorbing smoky flavors) while quality malts were dried over more expensive straw. Even in the 1890s, some porters were advertised as having ‘the flavor of the wood’[ref:amber-gold-black:55](), so the consumers had probably developed something like a Stockholm syndrome towards that smell and taste.

Fun Fact. Later, in the middle 18th century, brewers started to keep porter for maturing, thus giving birth to terms ‘mild porter’ and ‘stale porter’, so tavern keepers were not enjoying abolishing beer blending for long. The word ‘stout’ had not rested in peace as well: it soon became a designation for the thickest and heaviest porters. Also, the porter itself was always a ‘beer’, not ‘ale’: up until the middle 20th century you would have got a pint of porter if you had asked for a ‘beer’ in a British pub.

London brewers took a pedantic approach not only towards brewing procedures but to the beer business as a whole, being very rigorous about the statistics: when the beer was prepared, whom it was sold to, what was the price, etc. It was probably the first time in history when the accountants became more important than master brewers themselves[ref:swinnen-briski-beeronomics:31](). Later, in the 1770s, the Londoners were first to start using the measuring tools (namely, thermometers and hydrometers) for brewing, and it was them who installed the first steam engines in breweries as well[ref:meussdoerffer-history:24]().

The combination of these three factors — effectiveness, cheapness, and readiness for immediate use — had made a revolution in the brewing industry, or rather *had created* the industry. ‘Entire-butt’ took over London alehouses with a lightning speed, and after them, the entire world. This beer style had quickly become truly global, being shipped to the New World, Australia, the Russian Empire, India, and every other corner of the globe. 

The vat sizes were growing even faster. In 1736, Humphrey Parsons installed new barrels of a record 200 thousand liters each in his brewery; six decades later, the largest vat could hold quite close to three million liters of beer[ref:hornsey-history:449-450]() with iron staples alone weighing 80 tons. In 1814, a relatively small 600 thousand liters barrel exploded and caused a real beer flood that killed eight people[ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Beer_Flood).

The production scale and the level of monopolization were increasing as well. Law favored large-scale brewers and in the middle 18th century just two of them — Calvert and Thrale — were controlling more than 40% of beer production in the city[ref:change-is-brewing:237, 248]().

In 1751, painter William Hogarth created a pair of prints named ‘Beer Street’ and ‘Gin Lane’. The former depicts urban porter connoisseurs — cheerful, buoyant and healthy. (The latter, as you might have guessed, portrays exhausted and insane lovers of that god-awful gin.)

#### How to Taste

Sounds weird, but the first truly global beer style (e.g., porter) had eventually gone into decay and was not produced at all in the United Kingdom from the beginning of the 1950s till 1978. Stouts were luckier, as they were (and are) brewed by plenty of companies, starting with an international giant, Guinness. But you should take into account that contemporary porters and stouts are brewed using more modern technology, that of the second half of the 19th century (see the ‘Age of Empires’ chapter), which has nothing to do with an original ‘entire-butt’ porter. Several reconstructions exist, namely ‘Entire Butt English Porter’ by Salopian Brewery, but it's rather hard to find them. The best approximation of the early English porter is actually the brown ale of Flanders, the story of which we will tell in Section II of this book.

If we talk about modern porters, the most hailed ones are English Fuller's London Porter and Samuel Smith Taddy Porter and Scottish Harviestoun Old Engine Oil.

#### The trust that went bust

The Hogarth's diptych graphically outlines the processes that were brewing in 18th-century England. Being one the most potent locomotives of the Industrial revolution and accumulation of capital, beer production was finally pushed back by more advanced technologies. The tea, coffee, soft drinks, and strong alcohol industries were blooming and had soon become competitive powers (partly because of the re-investment of capital made on brewing). Wealthy social stratum still preferred prestigious grape wine over beer; less prosperous common folk had switched to cheap gin[ref:change-is-brewing:252-253]().

As the world population has been growing, the absolute beer industry numbers have also grown manifold since the 18th century. But the importance of brewing for the economy as well as average consumption had never reached those mind-blowing figures of early-industrial times.
